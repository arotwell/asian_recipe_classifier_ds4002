Research Question: To what extent can a computational model accurately predict the geographic origin of an Asian recipe based solely on its ingredient list.

Modeling Approach: We will use K-Prototypes Classifier and Multiclass Support Vector Machine (mSVM). K- Prototypes is an unsupervised learning model that considers categorical and numeric data [3]. This is helpful for examining recipes holistically, which often include numerical nutrition facts and cooking times alongside categorical food variables. The SVM algorithm considers each feature to be a vector and finds the hyperplane that differentiates one from another based on the variable of interest. This is an effective technique for separating out recipes based on ingredients, spices, and nutrition facts. It can consider categorical variables by one-hot-encoding them into vectors [4]. The combination of the two should work effectively in differentiating recipes accurately.
